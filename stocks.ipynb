    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds on the projectexploration of the 'House Stock Watcher\" data set. This uses the same data set along with the additional Party Affiliation data inserted in previous project. In continuation we now attempt explore a prediction problem involving the same data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to form a <b> prediction of the Party Affiliation of a given Individual representative, given their stock trading hitsory.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above prediction represents a <b>_'Classification Problem'_</b> , where out target variable will be the Party of the representative, as recorded in the <b> party </b> of our dataset. Our evalutation metrics will be the <b>_representative , ticker , type _</b> columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we will use to judge the prediction will be _**accuracy**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because there are no real ethical concerns that would make us want to use measures like precision or return on this data set, it is merely concerned with making a prediction on the party of a representative.\n",
    "Any False Negative or False Positives predicted by this model would not lead to any life-threatening or ethically concerning isses, therefore it is appropriate to just check for the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The baseline model of this project contains a total of 4 nominal features: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>representative</b>\n",
    "* <b>ticker</b>\n",
    "* <b>type</b>\n",
    "* <b>party</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized these columns for this project with belief that we can predict <b>party</b> using the values contained in of <b>(Representative</b>, <b>ticker</b>, <b>type)</b> and \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Feature Engineering</b> is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We omitted null and \"Libertarian\" for the party columns and concentrate on the two biggest groupings, \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\". We converted the <b>party</b> and <b>ticker</b> data into a <b>Binary format</b> using <b>\"Binarizer\"</b> with \"R\" set to 1 and \"D\" set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we convert the <b> type </b> column into a binary format as well. This is done because there are 5 types of stock trades, 4 of which were variants of *sale*. As a result we found it prudent to treat all variations as just 'sales'. Lastly, we convert the column into a binary format by setting the \"type\" column to 1 when it is \"purchase\" and to 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the representative and ticker columns contain data which are multi-categorical, we changed these columns using \"<b>OneHot Encoding</b>,\" which divides a category feature into a number of binary features, to make sure the numbers are presented correctly for the sake of our exploration. OneHot Encoding will only contain a 1 for one of the onehot encoded columns while the rest will contain a 0 in any given row because we wanted to have all data encoded with binary format without losing any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we incorporate all of these 'engineered' features into a <b>Pipeline</b> object:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of the Pipeline, we incorporate our <b>OneHot Encoder</b> and used a <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> as the predicting feature of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this model, our **accuracy scores** are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Baseline Training set Accuracy*: **79%**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Baseline Test set Accuracy*: **80%**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we attmpt to determine whether or not we could increase accuracy score in this Final Model. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways through which we can improve our model is <b>adjusting hyperparameters</b> on our <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> class . In our Baseline Model, the hyperparameters we feed into our Random ForestClassfier() were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* max_depth* = 7\n",
    "* n_estimators* = 7 \n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to see if there was a better combination of these hyperparamters to improve the accuracy of prediciotn model. To achive this, we used <b>GridSearchCV</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV performs k-fold cross-validation to identify the set of hyperparameters that provides the best validation performance on average from arrays that we created for hyperparameters. \n",
    "Upon fitting our training sets on this GridSearchCV() object we use *grids.best_params_* t0 obtain the best combination of hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* max_depth* = 92\n",
    "* n_estimators* = 44\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these parameters above allows to obtain a much higher accuracy score from our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Final Training set Accuracy*: **99.8%**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Final Test set Accuracy*: **99.6%**\n",
    "\n",
    "These above results imply a satisfactory level of Accuracy for our developed predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the Fairness of our model we explore the question of whether the predictions of the model was _**fair**_ , i.e they did not predict one subset of our data better than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore the fiarness on the **type** column of stock trades that took place. As explained earlier, we Binarized the values in type to only inlcude  0 and 1 , representing *Sale* and *Purchase*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then used a permutation test to test for fairness. Our Null and Alternate Hypotheses are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Null Hypothesis</b>: This model is fair; the accuracy for the type two subsets are roughly the same\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Alternative Hypothesis</b>: This model is unfair; the accuracy for the purchase subset is higher than the sale subset\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed <b>Permutation Test</b> 10,000 times with a 95% confidence interval, and the results show that our p value is**0.17**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This number exceeds the 0.05 value that a 95% confidence interval suggests. We fail to <b>reject the null hypothesis</b> as a consequence, suggesting that our model is reasonably fair for the **type** column, and does not predict one subgroup of **type** better than another.\n",
    "\n"
